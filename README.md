Machine Learning--  Machine learning is the process of making systems that learn and improve by themselves, by being specifically programmed.The ultimate goal of machine learning is to design algorithms that 
automatically help a system gather data and use that data to learn more.Systems are expected to look for patterns in the data collected and use them to make vital decisions for themselves.
In general, machine learning is getting systems to think and act like humans, show human-like intelligence, and give them a brain. In the real world, there 
are existing machine learning models capable of tasks like:
     Separating spam from actual emails, as seen in Gmail
     Correcting grammar and spelling mistakes, as seen in autocorrect
